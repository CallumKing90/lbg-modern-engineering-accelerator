## What are the potential business drivers? (20min)

There are many reasons a business may want to migrate to the cloud. Undoubtedly one of the more common reasons for a business making the move is to reduce IT costs but when we scratch the surface it's not hard to find other reasons to migrate.

> **Get your thinking cap on**: Breakout Rooms 10 minutes: What reasons might encourage a business to migrate their infrastructure to the cloud?

Let's have a look at some potential drivers:

- Reduce IT costs
  - Organisations no longer need large upfront costs to invest in their infrastructure (or renewals/replacements) but instead only pay for what they use.
- Increased agility
  - The ability to quickly provision on-demand services in the cloud can drastically reduce delivery times of software enabling business to quickly adapt and get products to market faster than ever before.
- Improved security
  - The ability to leverage the security provided by cloud providers is invaluable.
- No more end-of-life concerns
  - With cloud, the concers of out of date or broken hardware are passed to the provider. As a consumer you will have access to modern hardware without worrying about what happens when it breaks or becomes outdated.
- Consolidation of data centers
  - No need to maintain your own data centers anymore!
- Scalability
  - Instantly scale up and down so that you only use and pay for what you require.
- Environmental benefits
  - In a Microsoft study in 2020, it was found that moving to the cloud can be up to 93% more energy efficient than traditional on-premise data centres.

## Why cloud? (20 min)

You’re the CEO of a travel agency that has branch offices in Taiwan, China, Japan, and the United States.

The vast majority of your company’s business — $30 billion TWD's ($974 million USD's) worth — is conducted via the website. Customers visit the website, review travel destinations, and book online.

Your IT administrators need to make hardware and software updates that take the website offline periodically. This isn't ideal for a travel agency that services customers around the world in various time zones, but you deal with it.

But then, during an effort to upgrade the security settings for the database that stores personal information about your customers (payment details, passport numbers, home addresses, etc.), your website’s performance is disrupted for two days. The two days down equates to around $35 million TWD ($1.13 million USD) in lost website revenues.

How do you prevent this from EVER happening again?

The answer (at least in part) has to do with the cloud.

## What Is The Cloud? (10 min)

In your breakout room teams, define "the cloud."

In addition to covering what it is at a high level, can you answer:

- How does it work?
- How is it purchased?
- What functionality does it provide?

How did it go? Post your answers in Teams.

Cloud computing is on-demand computing resources delivered to you via the internet.

Put roughly, a cloud is a series of computers that exists in a data center. These computers are strung together to create some sort of service. Resources are efficiently pooled together over a virtual infrastructure.

Basically, the cloud is just somebody else's servers.
